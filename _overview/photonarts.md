            <tr>
                <td><img src="assets/img/icons/UIPhotonArtEndAttract.png"></td>
                <td>End Attraction</td>
                <td>A charged PA that deals huge amounts of damage, this is your main PA when you canâ€™t use Satellite Cannon. 
                                                        However, it shares the same flaws with Satellite Cannon in that it has a limited range, and roots you in place while charging.
                                                        Aiming End Attract is very important; in the right position, you can hit weak spots on enemies multiple times..</td>

            <tr>
                <td><img src="assets/img/icons/UIPhotonArtSatelliteCannon.png"></td>
                <td>Satellite Cannon</td>
                <td>Quite literally a laser from the sky that rains damage upon a single position. A bit of a lengty charge similar to End Attract
                                                        with a better use against humanoid bosses like Flame Diamos or tiny weakpoints like Zeshrayda when toppled over. </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><img src="assets/img/icons/UIPhotonArtHomingEmission.png"></td>
                <td>Homing Emission & Type-0</td>
                <td>The vanilla version requires manual aiming to lock on (up to) 6 targets,
                                                        which can be very tedious and impractical given what boss you're up against. Type-0 fires all 6 shots and has less PP cost, making its average damage output higher than vanilla.
                                                        It's your fastest PA used for Standing Snipe filler so best to get comfortable with it. </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><img src="assets/img/icons/UIPhotonArtParallelSlider.png"></td>
                <td>Parallel Slider & Type-0</td>
                <td>Has i-frames on the twirl start up when crafted, quite useless vanilla due to type-0 having susatinability and movement.
                                                        One of more favored PAs when soloing bosses to deal damage on the go and set up Standing Snipe with i-frames.</td>

                <td><img src="assets/img/icons/UIPhotonArtDivineLauncher.png"></td>
                <td>Divine Launcher & Type-0</td>
                <td>The big bad. Divine Launcher can almost send enemies to the heavens with the large AoE blast it has. Vanilla is just a non-chargable version,
                                                        while Type-0 gains a larger AoE and more damage. Precast for best effect and watch as you OHKO things even on XH difficulty. </td>

            <tr>
                <td><img src="assets/img/icons/UIPhotonArtSphereEraser.png"></td>
                <td>Sphere Eraser</td>
                <td>Think AIS laser but drains your PP very quickly. Has a low turning speed so its most wisely used when mowing down spawns or limited moving / stationary targets.
                                                        It's good DPS for the amount of time it takes to use. </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><img src="assets/img/icons/UIPhotonArtConcentrateOne.png"></td>
                <td>Concentrate One</td>
                <td>Simple triple shot PA with excellent range and good PP efficiency. Mainly used to take care of mobs quicker than an overkill Divine Launcher.
                                                        With it's simplicity and range, it's a common favorite when conserving PP during mobbing.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><img src="assets/img/icons/UIPhotonArtRodeoDrive.png"></td>
                <td>Rodeo Drive and Type-0</td>
                <td>Dunk on enemies with type-0 and zoom ahead of MPAs with this excellent travelling PA. It powers up after about 2 seconds,
                                                        noted by a larger spark when flying. Vanilla just does a little burnout you can brag about to your friends when you hit the car meetup on Tuesday nights, but pointless otherwise.</td>
