    <p>
        The weapons used by Ranger are the Assault Rifle and Launcher:
            <ul>
                <li>Assault Rifles are the middle-ranged, single target weapon, with noticeable charge times on their 2 powerful PAs that can quickly take down threats before they move. 
                    Rifle provides options for other situations as well like mobbing, but it’s not as strong as the Ranger’s secondary.
                </li>
                <hr>
                <li>Launchers are the short ranged, AoE weapon that requires good positioning and aim to make the most out of their slow PAs. 
                    If done right however, Launchers will decimate mobs with ease. 
                </li>
            </ul>

                <td>Ranger's main bossing tool with a selection of tools for different enemy sizes. 
                                                        The main feat this weapon brings is powerhouse Photon Arts such as End Attraction and Satellite Cannon. 
                                                        It also has good sustain PAs like Parallel Slider-0 and Homing Emission for more mobile targets.    </td>

                <td>Launcher</td>
                <td>Absolutely a pocket nuke with some of the best mobbing capability in the game! 
                                                        Launcher is slower but with precision and precasting your PAs you can demolish enemies immediately on spawn or soon after.
                    Mowing down spawns with Sphere Eraser, dunking heads with Rodeo Drive-0 or sending bodies flying with Divine Launcher-0 can be quite addicting, 
                    just ask Fourier
