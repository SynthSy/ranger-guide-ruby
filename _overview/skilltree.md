    <h3>Skill Tree</h3>
        <p>The Skill Tree of a Ranger is a very simple tree compared to the other classes in the game. Upon leveling Ranger,
        you are given the following Skills at no addtional SP cost:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>First Blood - Treats the first attack as a Just Attack, Techniques do not apply.</li>
        <li>Air Reversal - Enables you to do a Just Reversal midair.</li>
        <li>Just Reversal JA Combo - Grants a JA ring upon performing a Just Reversal.</li>
        <li>Next Jump - Allows you to double jump.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Aside from these Skills, placing levels into Ranger will give access to more Skill Points, thus allowing you
    to access more Skills on the Skill Tree.</p>
</section>
<p>Core skills from the Ranger tree are as followed. These are the skills you'll want to take as soon as possible. Prioritize them first!<p>

                <td>Increases your damage when attacking weak points. This synergizes with Weak Bullet and is a large chunk of where your damage come from.
                    Native weakpoints work as well such as enemies with headshot multipliers. </td>

                <td>Needed moreso on rifle than launcher, it's another large increase in your damage when standing still. </td>

            <tr>
                <td><img src="assets/img/icons/tacticstrap.png"> Tactics Trap, Stun Grenade, Gravity Bomb & Upper Trap</td>
                <td>With Tactics Trap allowing traps to regen PP on hit, Stun and Upper becomes on-demand sources of PP regen and help lower your downtime considerably.
                    Gravity Bomb is good crowd control with the ability to suck mobs in. </td>

                <td>Increases damage when moving. This activates when you walk, jump, fall, etc before an attack.</td>

                <td><img src="assets/img/icons/weakbullet.png"> Weak Bullet</td>
                <td>Loads (up to) 6 bullets that increases the Part Damage Modifier (PDM) by 120%, essentially making that part take 20% more damage.
                    There is no reason not to take this and max it, but learning how to use it properly has it's own learning curve. </td>

            <tr>
                <td><img src="assets/img/icons/massive-bullet.png"> PP Save Bullet</td>
                <td>Reduces PP consumption of PAs and Technics by 20% when any bullet is loaded. If a rifle bullet is loaded the effect is only available for rifles, same for launcher. Pretty neat, isn't it?</td>
