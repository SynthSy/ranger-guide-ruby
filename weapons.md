		<h3>What’s the damage chart for Weapons?</h3>
		<p>
			The following links contains rough estimates on weapons, and assumes that the weapon is +35, 
			and potentials such as the Fornis series matching element weaknesses are on. 
			This chart also assumes the best conditions for Rangers such as Standing Snipe, Sharp Shooter, etc. are activated. 
			An additional consideration is that these weapons are fully affixed; labels like <strong>DIM [170, 433]</strong> 
			denotes a +170 R-ATK affix with 4%/3%/3% <strong><a href="http://www.bumped.org/psublog/episode-5-s-class-abilities/">S-class abilities</a></strong> for example.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Note that the damage chart only shows raw damage and does not consider realistic situations, 
			such as fighting bosses. Uses Piercing Shell notation for rifles and Concentrate One for launchers. 
			Overall multipliers used are from Hunter subclass.</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			Thank you to <b>SCMSV (Spin)</b> for organizing these weapon tier lists.
