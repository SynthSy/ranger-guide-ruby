		<h3>What’s the damage chart for Weapons?</h3>
		<p>
			The following links contains rough estimates on weapons, and assumes that the weapon is +35, 
			and potentials such as the Fornis series matching element weaknesses are on. 
			This chart also assumes the best conditions for Rangers such as Standing Snipe, Sharp Shooter, etc. are activated. 
			An additional consideration is that these weapons are fully affixed; labels like <strong>DIM [170, 433]</strong> 
			denotes a +170 R-ATK affix with 4%/3%/3% <strong><a href="http://www.bumped.org/psublog/episode-5-s-class-abilities/">S-class abilities</a></strong> for example.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Note that the damage chart only shows raw damage and does not consider realistic situations, 
			such as fighting bosses. Uses Piercing Shell notation for rifles and Concentrate One for launchers. 
			Overall multipliers used are from Hunter subclass.</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			Thank you to <b>SCMSV (Spin)</b> for organizing these weapon tier lists.

			The list takes min-maxing into account, thus the highest SSA damage %’s are used for applicable weapons. 
			Insight provided by <b>darkmark009</b> has led to setting base attack power at 2.5k, as:
			
			<blockquote class="blockquote text-right">
				<p class="mb-0">
					There’s no way you’re going to have only 1.5k non-weapon attack, when you have [attack buffs such as] Shifta drink, 
					Shifta, team attack buff, not to mention units+timed abilities, and so on.

			Tweak the base ATP to see how weapons scale with higher/lesser stats.

		<h3>How important is elements on a weapon?</h3>
		<p>
			Consider the following weapon:
		</p>
		<img src="assets/img/page-img/pso2_2017-10-09_15-16-59.png" class="img-fluid">
		<p class="pt-2">
			Although it looks strong, it’s actually quite weak. Take a closer look at the element value:
		</p>
		<img src="assets/img/page-img/chrome_2017-10-09_15-26-19.png">
		<p class="pt-2">
			Element value is an additional bonus (+xx%) to weapon’s attack, so using a PSO2 Damage Calculator, 
			20 element vs 60 element (60 element for <img src="assets/img/icons/rarity/uistar13.png"> weapons only) would look like the following, 
			assuming everything is turned off (no Fury Stance, no anything):
		</p>
		<img src="assets/img/page-img/chrome_2017-10-09_15-30-59.png" class="img-fluid">
		<p class="pt-2">
			That’s a massive gap between the two! Element type is also important as it’s an additional +20% bonus 
			against enemies weak to your weapon, so <strong>on-element weakness vs off-element weakness & 20 element vs 60 element,</strong> 
			the damage calculator would look like this:
		</p>
		<img src="assets/img/page-img/chrome_2017-10-09_15-35-19.png" class="img-fluid">
		<p class="pt-2 font-weight-bold">TL;DR: Weapon elements, both type and value, are very important in maximizing your damage.</p>
		<h4 class="pt-2">What are the best elements for weapons?</h4>
		<p>
			The best element for weapons is Light, due to important endgame bosses being weak to Light. 
			Every other element doesn’t matter as much, so you’re free to pick after having at least 1 good Light-element Rifle.

		<h3>Is crafting my old NT weapons worth it?</h3>
		<p>
			Yes and no. Crafting just any NT weapon could result in you wasting millions of meseta and lots of time. 
			Ideally there are a handful of weapons (and/or) weapon series that are worth crafting. 
			To easily understand what’s worth crafting, it’s pretty much required that it’s within <strong>Austere-NT‘s</strong> 
			level of power when fully extended. Recommended weapons would be <strong>Invade-NT and Ceres</strong>, with some special cases 
			such as <strong>SSPN Launcher-NT and Dio Tigredor-NT</strong>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Crafting is generally very expensive and opens opportunities for multi-class weapons or just filling 
			in some empty gear spots. If you already have some of the endgame weapons such as <strong>Atlas Ex, Lightstream Xion 
			or Liberate series</strong>, take some time to evaluate if crafting is the right choice for you.

		<h3>What SSAs should I use on my weapons?</h3>
		<p>
			SSA’s or Super Special Abilities <img src="assets/img/icons/sclassabilityicon.png"> are capable of making a weapon 
			that supports them certainly viable via utility, damage or both. For Ranger, it’s suggested to find a balance between PP 
			and damage focused SSAs to get the best of both worlds.
