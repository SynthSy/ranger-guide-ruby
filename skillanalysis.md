    <h4>Level 90 Cap</h4>
            <p>Ranger doesn’t have newer options with the additional 5 SP from Level 90 cap, but there are a few considerations (with their own pros and cons):</p>
            <blockquote class="blockquote">
                <ul class="mb-0">
                    <li>[First Hit] is more effective when soloing, and has applications in multi-play/mobbing situations where the additional +20% damage would help one-shot enemies, but effectiveness lies on whether the player can plan in advance.</li>
                    <li>[Weak Hit Blast Bonus] synergizes well in mobbing situations, and especially with weapons that grant PB bonuses such as Ares and/or Austere. But, against raid bosses WHBB isn’t as effective.</li>
                    <li>[x Bullets] can activate PP Save Bullet on Launcher for 20% PP reduction; however procc’ing status with the bullets isn’t useful outside of extremely specific cases, and it may be difficult to activate Standing Snipe often while loaded with Launcher bullets.</li>
                </ul>
