			<h3 data-toc-skip>Ranger Gearing</h3>
			<h4 data-toc-skip>Is critical chance useful?</h4>
			<p class="bold">Credit goes to an anonymous reader for elaborating some points about critical chance.</p>
			<p>
				Yes and no. Weapons have a damage variance where you deal damage within a set range (95-97% is the minimum).
			</p>
			<p>
				In PSO2, criticals deal <strong>100%</strong> of your possible damage in that instance. 
				They are not <strong>150/200%</strong> more damage in other games that use critical chance (and by extension critical damage).
			</p>
			<p>
				In the case of <b>Ranger/Hunter</b> your average damage would increase if you stacked critical chance through various sources:
				<ul>
					<li><strong>+15%/+15/+12%</strong> from <a href="http://www.bumped.org/psublog/episode-5-s-class-abilities/">S-Class Abilities</a> (Wise Skill)</li>
					<li><strong>+50%</strong> from S4:Pursing Eclipse</li>
					<li><strong>+30%</strong> from Bouncer's Critical Field</li>
					<li><strong>+25%</strong> from Hunter's Fury Stance Critical</li>
					<li><strong>+20%</strong> from Techer's Shifta Critical</li>
					<li><strong>+20%</strong> from R/Critical Strike Shoot</li>
					<li><strong>+5%</strong> base</li>
				</ul>
				So while Ranger has a way to reach +100%, some of them are conditional 
				and/or requires you to give up some skills and/or certain S-class abilities.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>With the introduction of S4:Pursing Eclipse however,</strong> 
				Ranger <b>can</b> reach +100% critical chance without losing anything, 
				provided you are willing to sacrifice S4:Steadfast Courage for it.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>However</b>, other subclasses like <strong>Phantom or Etoile</strong> allow Ranger to utilize crit without the need 
				of external critical rate boosters (Techer, Bouncer, etc) or SSAs like Wise Skill. 
				This allows Ranger to use SSAs like S3: Skilled Strike 2 (+5% critical damage) and have damage 
				scale up further when Shifta Critical and/or Critical Field are applied.

			<h3>Mag</h3>
			<p class="pb-1">
				A standard Ranger mag has +200 R-ATK, as shown below:
			</p>
			<img src="assets/img/page-img/pso2_2017-09-14_16-55-33.png" class="img-fluid" alt="mag info">
			<p class="pt-1 pb-1">
				To quote Nishikawak's advice on efficient feeding for mags:
				<blockquote class="blockquote">
					<p class="mb-0">
						Start off by feeding your mag two 9* weapons of the ATK-type 
						(Ex: weapons with red background for S-ATK) you would want to level along with one 8★ 
						weapon of the same type, then wait until the energy of your mag is fully drained.						
					</p>
					<p class="mb-0">
						Proceed to feed it 3x 4★ (S-ATK), 5★ (R-ATK) or 6★ (T-ATK) furniture respectively. 
						This will give you the maximum of ATK and ensure you never gain a level of DEX. 
						<strong>(Furniture can be bought at the My Room Shop Attendant in back of the Shop Area or in player shops)</strong>
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				As for Photon Blast choices, the only viable choices are Ketos Proi for its fast PP regeneration, 
				or Julius Nykta to help clear mobs via super suction effect.
			</p>
			<p>Trigger Actions and Auto Actions are personal preference.</p>

			<h3>Affixes</h3>
			<p>
				<b>This guide assumes you’ve understand what is affixing.</b><br>
				<b>If not, go read <a href="https://tinyurl.com/gibmeplease" target="_blank">Princess Luna’s explanation on the affixing system in PSO2.</a></b>
			</p>
			<p>
				Aim for around <strong>1k+ HP, 160+ PP,</strong> and as much <strong>R-ATK as you can afford (minimum 100 R-ATK per unit and weapon)</strong> 
				on your affixes. For Ultra Hard content, a suggested baseline would be around <strong>1.3k+ HP and 175+ PP.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Weapons have access to <strong><a href="https://pso2.arks-visiphone.com/wiki/Ability_Factors" target="_blank">Special Ability Factors</a></strong>, 
				granting you affixing options that may not be possible on Units.
			</p>
			<p>
				Affixes in bold are expensive and/or hard to acquire.<br>
				Affixes in italics are outdated.<br>
				As for what to put on, here’s some possible suggestions:
